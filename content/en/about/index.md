title: About Me
short: A short story about Me
---

When I was 7,
I realized that I could handle computers.
When I was 14 I started programming with a small laptop and got my first programming experience.
I did an internship a year later,
where I learned how to get involved in team projects,
how to solve problems and how to understand them.
After school,
I continued my education in this field with an apprenticeship as an information technology assistant and finally decided to pursue a career as a software developer.
I then decided to start a dual study program as a mathematical technical software developer to get to know the field from a more theoretical and at the same time practical point of view.
